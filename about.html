										My Computer Science major has exposed me to a variety of programming and mathematical experiences. I have developed a game and truth table creator in Python and written code for data analysis in R. Since then, my coursework has focused on object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms in Java, as well as understanding the discrete mathematics that underpin the study of Computer Science. Currently, I am taking courses on Advanced Algorithms, Computer Architecture and Biometrics and am very eager to understand how these interesting topics relate to real-life applications.

										Outside of the classroom, you can find me at Middlebury's community service house. Volunteering has always played a big role in my life; after moving to Peru, I quickly realized I was among the priviledged few. My passion for playing the violin and to help out others in my community merged in the form of a start-up I created with other musicians and friends. The <i>'Learning through Music'</i> program strives to provide children in the outskirts of Lima, Peru with the musical instruments and classes necessary for them to start building a passion for learning music that otherwise they may have never have discovered. I now want to explore innovative ways to combine my newfound passion in tech with community building!
